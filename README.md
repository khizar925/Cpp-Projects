# C++ Console Projects

This repository contains four console-based C++ projects developed as part of the coursework for the Bachelor of Science program in Software Engineering. Each project serves as a practical exercise to reinforce programming concepts and enhance proficiency in C++.

## Projects Included:

1. **QuizTaking**: 
    - A console application for taking quizzes. 
    - Users can answer multiple-choice questions and receive immediate feedback on their responses.

2. **Bank**:
    - A console-based banking system.

    - Users can interact with the system to perform tasks like searching for books and managing library inventory.

4. **To-Do List**:
    - A simple to-do list manager.
    - Allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and remove tasks from the list.

## Usage:
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to the project directory.
- Compile the source files using a C++ compiler.
- Run the executable file generated to launch the respective project.

## Note:
- All projects are console-based and written in C++.

Feel free to explore each project, experiment with the code, and enhance your understanding of C++ programming concepts. Happy coding! ðŸš€
